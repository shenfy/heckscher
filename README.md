## Installation
### Method 1
Create zip of the subfolder or file of the addon you would like to install, then use the Blender GUI menu Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install... to install individual addons.

The release section in this repository may also contain packaged files you can download and install.

### Method 2
Add a user-defined add-on path in Blender.
Point the Edit > Preferences > File Paths > Scripts to the root folder of your clone of this repository.

If you already have a script folder set in Blender, simply copy the subfolders or files of the add-on in this repository into your script folder.

Save the preferences and restart Blender to load the new add-ons.
Enable the ones you'd like to use under Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
